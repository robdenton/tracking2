      <SubHeading title="What we're measuring" />
      <Para>
        We measure <strong>incremental</strong> signups and activations — the
        extra signups or paying customers we can attribute to a specific
        marketing activity, above what would have happened anyway. The goal is
        to answer: &ldquo;Did this newsletter / video / post actually move the
        needle, or were those signups coming regardless?&rdquo;
      </Para>

      <SubHeading title="The two data inputs" />
      <Para>
        Everything flows from two tables synced daily from Google Sheets:
      </Para>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-sm text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-3 space-y-1 ml-1">
        <li>
          <strong>Activities</strong> — one row per marketing event (newsletter
          send, YouTube video, LinkedIn post, etc.), with its channel, date,
          partner name, click counts, and cost.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Daily metrics</strong> — one row per channel per day, with
          total signups and activations for that channel on that day. This is
          the raw signal we measure against.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <SubHeading title="The baseline" />
      <Para>
        For each activity, we look at the <strong>14 days before it</strong> to
        establish a &ldquo;normal day&rdquo; for that channel. We take the
        average daily signups across those 14 days. This is our expected rate —
        what we would have seen without the activity.
      </Para>
      <Callout label="Example">
        A newsletter goes out on 15 January. The baseline is 1–14 January. If
        we averaged 42 signups/day over those 14 days, our expected rate is 42
        signups/day.
      </Callout>

      <SubHeading title="The post window" />
      <Para>
        After the activity, we count signups over a defined window and compare
        to what we expected. The window length varies by channel (see each
        channel section below) because different channels have different
        engagement tails.
      </Para>

      <SubHeading title="The incremental" />
      <Para>
        Incremental signups = observed signups in the post window minus expected
        signups (baseline average × window length). We floor at zero — we don&rsquo;t
        model negative lift.
      </Para>
      <Callout label="Formula">
        incremental = max(0, observed &minus; (baseline avg &times; post window days)
      </Callout>

      <SubHeading title="Confidence" />
      <Para>
        Each activity gets a confidence rating — a quick signal-to-noise check
        that tells you how clearly the lift stands out from normal baseline
        variability. It is <em>not</em> a statistical p-value.
      </Para>
      <div className="flex flex-col gap-2 my-3">
        <div className="flex items-start gap-3">
          <Pill label="" value="HIGH" color="green" />
          <span className="text-sm text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            The lift is more than <strong>twice</strong> the typical day-to-day
            variability in the baseline. A clear signal above the noise.

      <SectionHeading id="metrics" emoji="📊" title="Metric definitions" />

      <Para>
        These are the core metrics shown on the newsletter analytics page. Each
        has a specific definition — understanding the difference between the
        &ldquo;actual&rdquo; and &ldquo;attributed&rdquo; variants is key to
        reading the data correctly.
      </Para>

      <SubHeading title="Account created" />
      <div
        id="account-created"
        className="scroll-mt-6"
      />
      <Para>
        The total number of Granola accounts created during the post-windows of
        all newsletter activities in the selected period. This is the raw
        observed count — it includes signups that would have happened anyway
        without the newsletter. It is <strong>not</strong> adjusted for baseline.
      </Para>
      <Callout label="Example">
        If your baseline is 30 signups/day and 50 people signed up on the day of
        a send, &ldquo;Account created&rdquo; shows 50. The incremental figure
        would show 20.
      </Callout>

      <SubHeading title="NAU (New Activated User)" />
      <div
        id="nau"
        className="scroll-mt-6"
      />
      <Para>
        A New Activated User is an account that completed the activation
        event (paying or entering a free trial) during the post-window of a
        newsletter activity. Like &ldquo;Account created&rdquo;, this is the raw
        observed count — not adjusted for baseline. The activation rate
        (NAU ÷ Account created) reflects the quality of signups driven by
        a newsletter send.
      </Para>

      <SubHeading title="eNAU (Estimated NAU)" />
      <div
        id="enau"
        className="scroll-mt-6"
      />
      <Para>
        A forward-looking estimate of activations calculated as{" "}
        <strong>clicks × historical click-to-activation rate</strong>. It is
        used to project impact before observed activation data is available (e.g.
        for very recent sends). Once post-window activation data is collected,
        the actual NAU figure supersedes eNAU.
      </Para>

      <SubHeading title="Incremental account created" />
      <div
        id="incremental-account-created"
        className="scroll-mt-6"
      />
      <Para>
        The number of accounts created <strong>above the expected baseline</strong>,
        attributed to newsletter activity. The model takes the 14-day pre-send
        average, multiplies by the 2-day post-window, and subtracts from the
        observed total. The remainder is the uplift.
      </Para>
      <Para>
        When multiple newsletters have overlapping 2-day post-windows, the
        combined uplift is split proportionally by click count — each newsletter
        receives a share of the pooled incremental equal to its share of total
        clicks. This prevents double-counting.
      </Para>
      <Callout label="Formula">
        incremental = max(0, observed &minus; (baseline avg &times; 2 days))<br />
        When overlapping: each newsletter&rsquo;s share = its clicks ÷ total clicks across overlapping sends
      </Callout>

      <SubHeading title="Incremental NAU" />
      <div
        id="incremental-nau"
        className="scroll-mt-6"
      />
      <Para>
        The number of activations above the expected baseline, attributed to
        newsletter activity. Uses exactly the same uplift and proportional
        attribution methodology as incremental account created, but applied to
        activation events rather than signup events. Incremental NAU will always
        be ≤ incremental account created for a given period.
      </Para>

        Two variants are shown for each conversion type:
      </Para>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-sm text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-3 space-y-1 ml-1">
        <li>
          <strong>Blended CPA</strong> — total spend ÷ total accounts created (or
          NAU) in post-windows. This includes baseline signups that would have
          happened anyway, so it understates the true cost of a newsletter-driven
          conversion.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Incremental CPA</strong> — total spend ÷ incremental accounts
          created (or NAU). This is the true marginal cost: how much did each
          additional signup or activation cost, above what would have happened
          without the newsletter?

      </div>

      <SubHeading title="Why 2 days?" />
      <Para>
        Newsletter engagement is strongly front-loaded. The overwhelming
        majority of opens, clicks, and resulting signups happen on the day of
        the send and the day after. Using a 7-day window (our default for other
        channels) would pick up signups that were almost certainly organic —
        people who would have signed up anyway — and incorrectly attribute them
        to the newsletter. The 2-day window reflects where the real engagement
        actually happens.
      </Para>

      <SubHeading title="Proportional attribution" />
      <Para>
        When two or more newsletters have overlapping post windows (e.g. two
        sends within 2 days of each other), the model avoids double-counting by
        splitting credit proportionally by click share. For each overlapping day,
        it pools each newsletter&rsquo;s pro-rated daily incremental (total
        incremental ÷ post-window days) and redistributes the pool by click
        share. If Newsletter A had 1,000 clicks and Newsletter B had 500, A gets
        ⅔ of the shared incremental and B gets ⅓. Activities that do{" "}
        <em>not</em> overlap get their own incremental back unchanged.
      </Para>
      <Para>
        The model uses <strong>actual measured clicks</strong> first, falling
        back to <strong>deterministic estimated clicks</strong>, then{" "}
        <strong>metadata estimated clicks</strong>. Activities with no click data
        receive zero attributed incremental.
      </Para>

      <SubHeading title="Baseline decontamination" />
      <Para>
        Because newsletters go out frequently — sometimes daily — each
        newsletter&rsquo;s 14-day baseline window almost always contains spikes
        caused by <em>other</em> newsletters. If we used the raw baseline
        average, we&rsquo;d set the bar artificially high and undercount lift.
      </Para>
      <Para>
        To fix this, we iteratively subtract the estimated impact of other
        concurrent newsletters from the contaminated baseline dates, then
        recalculate. We repeat until the numbers stabilise — typically in 1–2
        passes. See the <a href="#methodology-notes" className="text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">Methodology Notes</a> section for a worked example.

        These are YouTube videos directly tied to a paid sponsorship or

        <li>Recalculate all incrementals with the cleaned baselines. Repeat until the numbers stop changing meaningfully (usually 1–2 rounds).</li>
      </ol>
      <Para>
        Only same-channel activities contaminate each other. LinkedIn posts
        don&rsquo;t affect the newsletter baseline, and vice versa.
      </Para>

      <SubHeading title="Confidence is a heuristic, not a p-value" />
      <Para>
        The confidence rating tells you how large the observed lift is relative
        to the normal day-to-day noise in that channel&rsquo;s signups. HIGH
        means the signal is clearly above the noise. It does <em>not</em> mean
        we&rsquo;ve run a randomised controlled experiment — there&rsquo;s no
        holdout group. It&rsquo;s a quick sanity check to help prioritise which
        results to trust vs. which to treat with more caution.
      </Para>

      <SubHeading title="Deterministic floors" />
      <Para>
        For some activities we have direct-attribution data — for example, a
        unique tracking link that records exactly how many people clicked
        through and signed up. We call this the <strong>deterministic tracked
        signups</strong> floor. If the model&rsquo;s incremental estimate comes
        in below this floor, the floor wins. We never attribute fewer signups
        than we&rsquo;ve directly observed.
